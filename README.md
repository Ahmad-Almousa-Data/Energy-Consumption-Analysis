# Power BI Dashboard: Energy Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption across various regions and companies. It dynamically visualizes data using slicers, heatmaps, and cards to offer insights into total consumption, peak times, and regional trends.

## Features
1. **Summary Page**:
   - Total energy consumption with dynamic filtering (Date, Time, Region, State).
   - Gauges for maximum and minimum consumption values.
   - Region-wise and attribute-wise comparisons through bar and line charts.

2. **Hourly & Seasonal Analysis**:
   - Hourly heatmap to highlight consumption trends by the hour.
   - Seasonal bar charts and line charts showing energy usage across Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.
   - Dynamic slicers for deeper analysis by attributes and time.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Tools Used**: Power BI, Power Query, DAX.
- **Key Features**:
  - Data unpivoting for dynamic column selection.
  - Conditional formatting for heatmap visualization.
  - Dynamic measures for peak and least consuming areas.
  - Slicers for interactive filtering.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle: Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption/data).
- The dataset includes hourly energy consumption data across multiple regions and companies.

## Insights
1. **Total Consumption**: Dynamic analysis of energy usage across regions and time periods.
2. **Peak Trends**: Identification of peak hours and seasonal demand patterns.
3. **Regional Comparison**: Highlights the most and least consuming areas dynamically.
